    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance : Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or the parent class .if a child class inherits from more than one class, i.e. this child class is derived from multiple classes, we call it multiple inheritance in Python. This newly derived child class will inherit the properties of all the classes that it is derived from. A very simple real life example would be the one discussed above - a child inheriting properties of the father and mother.\n",
